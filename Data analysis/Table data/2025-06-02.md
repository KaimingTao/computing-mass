# Quick Table

A python implemented simple a quick table operation library.

The reason I create this one is because the commonly used tools like Pandas creates a lot of noises when you don't follow their syntax. It's annoying.

This library only implement very commonly used features, and it's pure implemented in python.


## How to use this library with Pandas

```
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(table.table)
```
